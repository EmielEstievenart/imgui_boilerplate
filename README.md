# cpp_boilerplate
A boilerplate layout for C++ projects using CMake. 

## special notes
* The project_name folder is added in the include folder so that includes can happen relative to the name of the library. 
* Minimal configuring is done in the CMakeLists in the source folder. This is so the potential library that is based of this repo can be included in larger projects by simply adding the subdirectory source.
